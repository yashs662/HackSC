# Project Description

24hr Hackathon project at SoCal Hacks.

## Inspiration

I LOVE MUSIC !!!! I always been interested in performing arts even though I may not have the musical abilities to produce a music video.

## What it does

GroovyMate is DAIN toolbox that allows uses to utilize the chat features to create a music video from an audio file that the user provides. GroovyMate uses external GPU-processing from Solana to power the generative and analytical capabilities. Users can additionally use the chat capabilities of DAIN and

## How we built it

DAIN, Nosana, HuggingFace, Python, Pytorch

## Challenges we ran into

Nosana not be available for an extended period (2 hours) , Choosing the Correct Models for Image Generation (Both the ImageGenerationPrompting Model and GenerativeImaging), Prompt Engineering to reduce hallucination and promote variety of images generated involving overarching theme.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

IT WORKS!!! They were praying on our downfall.

## What we learned

Teamwork, Delegation of Tasks, Repo Management, Working with elements, Usage of API, Tunneling,

## What's next for GroovyMate

Animating from the storyboards and allowing for the artist to edit the video in his vision (theming and animation style selection), Approve/Deny/Remake certain segments of video that do not match the artist's vision. Tools to assist in the creation of lyrics, background audio, and genre inspiration. Payment Processing for GPU allocation from Nosanna through DAIN
